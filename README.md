# 🌊 Nazaré Marine Analytics Dashboard
**Real-time Marine Data • Snowflake • StormGlass API • Streamlit • Forecasting**

This project implements a full big data pipeline using:

**StormGlass Marine Weather API**

**Snowflake (Snowpark + SQL + Streamlit)**

**Python ingestion scripts**

**Machine learning forecasting**

The system monitors real-time marine conditions at **Nazaré, Portugal**, one of the most dangerous big-wave zones on the planet.

## 📍 Coordinates Monitored:

**Latitude: 39.60475**

**Longitude: -9.085443**

Nazaré's waves reaching 20–30 meters pose significant risks to surfers, fishermen, and rescue teams.
This dashboard provides live monitoring, pattern insights, hazard detection, and 24 hour forecasting.

## 🔍 Notebook Analysis 


This notebook uses Snowpark to:

**✔ Load table from Snowflake**

Inspect schema

Validate datatypes

Count rows and timestamp range

**✔ Explore dataset (EDA)**

Wave height distributions

Time-series patterns across days

Correlations (wind ↔ wave, swell ↔ wave)

Daily summaries

**✔ Prepare ML-ready series**

Hourly resampling

Missing value interpolation

Normalized time index


## 🧪 SQL Analytical Queries

**Query #1 — Daily Wave Summary**

```sql
SELECT
    TO_DATE(TIMESTAMP) AS DAY,
    AVG(WAVE_HEIGHT) AS AVG_WAVE_HEIGHT,
    MAX(WAVE_HEIGHT) AS MAX_WAVE_HEIGHT,
    AVG(WIND_SPEED) AS AVG_WIND_SPEED,
    AVG(SWELL_HEIGHT) AS AVG_SWELL_HEIGHT
FROM STORM_MARINE_CLEAN
GROUP BY DAY
ORDER BY DAY DESC;
```

![SQL Query 1](screenshots/SQL_Query_1.png)

**Query #2 — Dangerous Wave Detection**

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS DANGEROUS_WAVE_COUNT,
    MIN(WAVE_HEIGHT) AS MIN_DANGER,
    MAX(WAVE_HEIGHT) AS MAX_DANGER,
    AVG(WAVE_HEIGHT) AS AVG_DANGER,
    TO_DATE(TIMESTAMP) AS DAY
FROM STORM_MARINE_CLEAN
WHERE WAVE_HEIGHT > 6.0
GROUP BY DAY
ORDER BY DAY DESC;
```

**Query #3 — Correlation Analysis**

```sql
SELECT
    CORR(WAVE_HEIGHT, WIND_SPEED) AS CORR_WAVE_WIND,
    CORR(WAVE_HEIGHT, SWELL_HEIGHT) AS CORR_WAVE_SWELL
FROM STORM_MARINE_CLEAN;
```

## 🌊 Why Nazaré Matters

Nazaré’s giant waves—powered by the deep **Nazaré Canyon**—can suddenly surge above **20–30 meters**, creating some of the most dangerous marine conditions in the world. These waves threaten:

- **Surfers**
- **Rescue teams**
- **Fishermen**
- **Tourists along the coastline**

This dashboard helps improve safety by providing:

- **Real-time wave monitoring**
- **Danger alerts**
- **Environmental insights** (wind, swell, water temperature)
- **24-hour wave forecasting**

Data-driven awareness in a location as extreme as Nazaré can help **protect lives** and support rapid decision-making.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining API data, Snowflake, and machine learning can deliver:

- A **live marine data pipeline**
- An interactive **Streamlit dashboard**
- **Analytical SQL insights**
- A simple but effective **forecasting model**

The result is a practical tool that enhances understanding of Nazaré’s hazardous conditions and showcases the power of modern cloud analytics.
